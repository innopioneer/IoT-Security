##Overview

The explosive growth of network traffic poses severe pressure on the Internet service providers to better manage their finite network resources. The diverse application requirements further stimulate the eager demand for the capacity of an intelligent network which can optimize for the diverse goals of individual application (e.g., throughput- or deadline-sensitive) as well as improve the overall network utilization. Application-driven networks, the new generation of intelligent and multi-tenant networks come with various promises in addressing the problems but also raise several new challenges in the area, including resource virtualization, network states measurement, efficient network control, Internet architecture implications, and etc.

This trend towards application-driven networks, called ADN, is gaining popularity in the telecommunication industry as well as in academia. Yet, this paradigm shift is at a very early stage and many interesting questions remain open in this regard. The ADN workshop will serve as an avenue to showcase and discuss ongoing work in this space from both academia and industry and to identify key challenges and potential solutions, with the ultimate goal of providing a roadmap for practical deployment in operational networks.

##Topics of Interest

We encourage the submission of work-in-progress papers in the area of application-driven networking, implementation, measurement, management, deployment, as well as Internet architecture implications. We look for submissions of previously unpublished work on topics including, but not limited to, the following:

Future Internet architecture design
Network measurement
Network resource virtualization and management
Network performance modeling and optimization
Network intelligence
Business models for service providers
Traffic classification and QoE models
Application-aware scheduling
Novel Network/Transport layer protocols
Important Dates
Paper submission: July 21, 2016 (23:59 EDT) Notification of decision: August 21, 2016 Camera-ready: September 2, 2016 (23:59 EDT)

##Paper Submission-Publication

Submissions must be original, unpublished work, not under consideration at another venue. Each submission must be a single PDF file no longer than six (6) pages in length (in two-column, 10-point format) including references, following the provided LaTeX style file. Papers should be submitted electronically via the submission site. Papers must exclude the author name and affiliation for double-blind peer reviewing by the program committee. Please upload your submissions to the workshop submission page. Authors are expected to present accepted papers in the workshop, and at least one author is required to register in order for the paper to appear in the proceedings and the IEEE digital library.
