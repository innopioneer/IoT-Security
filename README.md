# Overview

Recent advances on mobile computing, wireless communications, embedded systems have revolutionized the way of human-computer interaction. The Internet of Things (IoT), i.e., the major applications to this area, provide a platform integrated with smart end devices, and have made life convenient. However, along with the convenience of IoT, there are also the vulnerabilities and security attacks to IoT. Successful attacks targeted to IoT devices are not only invasive to user privacy, but also leading to malfunction of devices and control systems with severe financial, environmental and health losses. The goal of this workshop is to bring together internationally leading academic and industrial researchers in an effort to identify and discuss the major technical challenges and recent results aimed at addressing all aspects of security and privacy for IoT.

# Public Issue
This symposium takes place in conjunction with The 23nd IEEE International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems. Papers must be unpublished and must not be submitted for publication elsewhere. All papers will be reviewed by Program Committee members and other experts active in the field to ensure high quality and relevance to the conference. Submissions should include author information, abstract, 5-10 keywords, and be in PDF format. Each submission must not exceed 6 pages in the IEEE 8.5" x 11" two-column format with 10 point font, including tables, figures and references. Template formatting is located at http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html. The final version will be limited to 4 pages in IEEE proceeding format for conference papers. Up to 2 extra pages may be purchased.

Each submission should be regarded as an undertaking that, should the submission be accepted, at least one of the authors must register the paper and attend the conference to present the work in order for the accepted paper to be included into the IEEE digital library.
